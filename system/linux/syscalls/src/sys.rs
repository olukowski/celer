//! Linux system calls.
//!
//! Each system call documents its own:
//! - Behavior
//! - Kernel support
//! - Required privileges
//! - Errors
//!
//! Also, each system call has references to the "latest" source code of the
//! system call in the Linux kernel. The exact definiton of "latest" here
//! is: the latest version at the time of writing.
//!
//! The return value of a system call is the raw kernel return value.
//! Negative values in the range `[-4095, -1]` indicate errno codes;
//! the caller is responsible for interpreting them.
//! Note: there are some system calls that cannot fail.
